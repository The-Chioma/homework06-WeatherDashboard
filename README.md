# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and using localStorage to store any persistent data.


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN you search for a city

THEN you are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN you view current weather conditions for that city

THEN you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN you view the UV index

THEN you are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city

THEN you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

WHEN you click on a city in the search history

THEN you are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

WHEN you open the weather dashboard

THEN you am presented with the last searched city forecast
